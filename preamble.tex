% IMPORTS

% surprisingly, the order of some of these matter
% the following order works for me using TeXlive from MacTeX
% no guarantees for anyone/anything else

% font imports
\usepackage[T1]{fontenc}
\usepackage{courier}

% colors
\usepackage{color, xcolor}

% packages for appropriately floating captions
\usepackage{floatrow, caption}

% allow for frames/borders around text
% using TikZ allows for rounded corners
\usepackage[framemethod=TikZ]{mdframed}

% used for code listing
% minted (imported below) does not provide inline code - this does
\usepackage{listings}

% highlight code automagically via Pygments
% code listings will be organized numerically by section
% as opposed to chapter
\usepackage[section]{minted}

% single quotes in Verbatim environments are output as single quotes
% (silly, ain't it?)
\usepackage{upquote}
% the following hack fixes upquote use with minted
% when running Pygments 1.6
\AtBeginDocument{%
\def\PYZsq{\textquotesingle}%
}

% allow for Verbatim text in captions
\usepackage{cprotect}

% underline text correctly
% specify 'normalem' so that emphasis blocks are not replaced with underlined text
% used to create command to custom color hyperref links
\usepackage[normalem]{ulem}

% conditional logic in new environments
\usepackage{xstring}

% safely print URLs and create links
\usepackage[hidelinks]{hyperref}
