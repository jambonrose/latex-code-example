latex-code-example
==================

This project is meant to help jump start writers looking to display source code in LaTeX documents. The project provides a set of TeX files and a PDF of the output of said TeX files. The intention is that a reader may view the various code listing demonstrations in the PDF, and then read, learn, or simply copy the LATEX necessary to display their code in the same manner. Basic knowledge of LATEX is assumed.

The expected_output.pdf file is the place to start.

To test your system and verify it can output the same, please run `make` when in the project directory, then then compare expected_output.pdf to the newly created generated_output.pdf
