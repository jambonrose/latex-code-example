\begin{abstract}
This project is meant to help jump start writers looking to display source code in \LaTeX{} documents. The project provides a set of \TeX{} files and a PDF of the output of said \TeX{} files. The intention is that a reader may view the various code listing demonstrations in the PDF, and then read, learn, or simply copy the \LaTeX{} necessary to display their code in the same manner. Basic knowledge of \LaTeX{} is assumed.

We display code using the following: \verb|verbatim|, \verb|listings| (not to be confused with \verb|listing|), and \verb|minted|.

To avoid a monolithic \LaTeX{} document and make perusing the code simpler, each subsection is it's own \TeX{} file, as is the preamble.

Note that all code is licensed under the Simplified BSD License, a copy of which is included with the project code, found \link{https://github.com/jambonrose/latex-code-example}{on github}.
